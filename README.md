> **"Secure Every Phase. Protect Every Line."**

SecureFlow is an AI-powered security platform that integrates vulnerability scanning, SQUARE requirements engineering, and automated testing into a unified web interface for security-first development.

## Abstract

SecureFlow is a comprehensive web-based security platform designed to integrate security practices throughout the Software Development Lifecycle. It combines real-time vulnerability detection, structured requirements engineering, and automated security testing to enable development teams to build secure software from inception to deployment.

This project aligns with Software Development Security principles—promoting early defect detection, security requirements elicitation, threat modeling, and continuous security assurance.

## Objective & Purpose

### **Objective:**

To enable security-first development practices by providing integrated tools for vulnerability detection, requirements engineering, and security testing in one unified platform.

### **Purpose:**

- **Shift security left** in the SDLC through early vulnerability detection
- **Standardize security requirements** using proven methodologies
- **Automate security validation** with comprehensive testing suites
- **Enable informed decisions** through real-time metrics and analytics

## Problem Statement

Traditional security approaches often:

- Address vulnerabilities **after development** or in production
- Lack **structured requirements engineering** for security
- Require **multiple disconnected tools** for different security tasks
- Provide **limited guidance** on remediation strategies

**SecureFlow eliminates these limitations** by providing an integrated platform where security is embedded at every phase, not bolted on afterward.

## Why SecureFlow?
